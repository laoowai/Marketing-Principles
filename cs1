I.  WHAT IS MARKETING?  [LO1] 

	•	You’re already a marketing expert because you do many marketing activities every day, such as shopping for products.

	•	However, you may not have much experience developing products to reach different groups of people or segments.

	•	Marketing isn’t always easy to do—thousands of new offerings fail each year.

B.		Marketing: Delivering Value to Customers [LO 1-1]

	•	The American Marketing Association (AMA) represents those involved in the development and practice of marketing worldwide. It defines marketing as “the activity set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.”

	•	To serve both buyers and sellers, marketing seeks to:

	a.	Discover the needs and wants of prospective customers.

	b.	Satisfy these needs and wants.

	•	Prospective customers include:

	a.	Individuals buying for themselves and their households.

	b.	Organizations that buy for their own use or for resale.

	•	 Exchange:

	a.	Is the trade of things of value between a buyer and a seller so that each is better off after the trade.

	b.	Is the key to discovering and satisfying consumer needs and wants.

Slide 8


	C.	The Diverse Factors Influencing Marketing Actions

Senior management is depicted as a core surrounded by six departments: research and development, human resources, information systems, marketing, finance, and manufacturing. There are outside forces (society) which have an effect on the organization: alliances with other organizations, partnerships with suppliers, ownership from shareholders (owners), and relationships with customers. There are also influential environmental forces: social, economic, technological, competitive, and regulatory. In turn, the organization can have an impact on society and environmental forces.
 
SLIDE 9

	•	[Figure 1-1] A variety of other people, groups, and forces interact with marketing to shape the nature of its actions.  These include:

	a.	The organization itself, whose mission and objectives determine:
	•	What business it is in and…
	•	What goals it seeks.

	b.	Management, which is responsible for establishing these goals.

	c.	The marketing department:
	•	Works with a network of other departments.
	•	Develops customer-satisfying products so the organization can survive and prosper.
	•	Facilitates relationships, partnerships, and alliances with customers, shareholders, suppliers, and other organizations.

	•	Environmental forces:

	a.	Shape an organization’s marketing actions.

	b.	Include social, economic, technological, competitive, and regulatory forces.

	•	Marketing is affected by and impacts society.

	•	The organization must strike a balance among competing interests of:

	a.	Customers (low price; high quality; value).

	b.	Suppliers (high price).

	c.	Employees (high salaries and wages; benefits).

	d.	Shareholders (dividends).

	D.	What is Needed for Marketing to Occur

SLIDE 10

Four factors are required for marketing to occur:

	•	Two or more parties with unsatisfied needs.  A consumer who wants something, and a seller who wants to sell something.

	•	A desire and ability to satisfy these needs.

	a.	A consumer that can afford the time and money to purchase an offering.

	b.	A seller that has the offering available for purchase.

	•	A way for the parties to communicate.  The consumer learns about the product (that it exists) and where to get it.

	•	Something to exchange.  For a transaction to occur between a buyer and a seller:

	a.	Money or something else of value must be exchanged.

	b.	Each has satisfied each other’s unmet needs:
	•	The consumer—hunger.
	•	The seller—money, so it can remain in business.

Slide 12
II.  HOW MARKETING DISCOVERS AND
SATISFIES CONSUMER NEEDS  [LO 1-2] 

Discovering and satisfying consumer needs is critical to marketing.

	A.	Discovering Consumer Needs

	•	Marketing’s first objective: discover the needs of prospective consumers. Marketers use surveys, concept tests, crowdsourcing, and other tactics to better understand consumer ideas. 

	•	Consumers may not always know or be able to describe what they need or want. (Ex: Personal computers, smartphones, electric cars, etc.) Effective marketing research can help.

	B.	The Challenge: Meeting Consumer Needs with New Products

	•	Experts estimate that it takes 3,000 raw ideas to generate one commercial success. Of the estimated 33,000 new products introduced worldwide each month, roughly 40% will fail.

	•	Key principles for new product launches:

	a.	Focus on the consumer benefit.

	b.	Learn from past mistakes.

	•	Solutions to preventing product failures:

a.	Find out what consumers need and want.

b.	Produce what they need and want.

c.	Don’t produce what they don’t need or want.

	•	What are the potential benefits and “showstoppers” (factors that might doom the offering) for the following products:

	a.	Apple Newton 
	•	Benefits: Revolutionary personal digital assistant.
	•	Showstopper: Before its time.

[Video 1-2: StuffDot Strategies Video]

	b.	StuffDOT
	•	Benefits: Rewards consumers for online shopping and sharing.
	•	Showstoppers: Changing consumers shopping habits.

[Video 1-3: Pepsi True Ad]
	c.	Pepsi True.
	•	Benefits: Reduced calories, same flavor of Pepsi-Cola.
	•	Showstopper: Past transition sodas (regular to diet) have failed.

	•	Firms spend billions of dollars on marketing and technical research to reduce new-product failures.

SLIDE 16

	1.	Consumer Needs and Consumer Wants.

a.	Should marketers try to satisfy consumer needs or consumer wants?  Both! 
•	Debates center around:
	–	Definitions of needs and wants.
	–	The amount of freedom of choice given to prospective customers to make their own buying decisions.
	•	A need occurs when a person feels physiologically deprived of basic necessities, such as food, clothing, and shelter.
	•	A want is a felt need that is shaped by a person’s knowledge, culture, and personality.
	•	Marketing:
	–	Does not create the need for a product but…
	–	Does shape a person’s wants by creating an awareness of good products at convenient locations.

	b.	Does marketing persuade consumers to buy the “wrong” products?
	•	Marketing does try to influence what consumers buy.
	•	When should the government and society step in to protect consumers?
	–	There are no clear-cut answers, which is why legal and ethical issues are central to marketing.
–	Psychologists and economists debate the exact meanings of need and want.
SLIDE 17

b.	[Figure 1-2] Marketers carefully study prospective customers to understand:
The process begins within an organization's marketing department, where consumer needs are discovered through research. Based on this knowledge, concepts for products are created. These satisfy consumer needs by designing a marketing program having the right combination of product, price, promotion, and place. These products, services, or ideas are sent out of the department and presented to potential consumers: the market. They, in turn, provide information about their needs, which returns to the marketing department, where research is done on what consumer needs are.

	•	What they need and want.
	•	The forces that shape these needs and wants.

SLIDE 18

	2.	What a Market Is

	a.	Potential consumers make up a market, which is people with both the desire and the ability to buy a specific offering. 

	b.	All markets are ultimately people.

	c.	People who are aware of their unmet needs may have a desire for a product.

	d.	People must also have the ability—the authority, time, and money—to buy.

	e.	People can “buy” an idea that leads to an action.

	C.	Satisfying Consumer Needs

	•	An organization does not have the resources to satisfy the needs of all consumers.

	•	It focuses on the needs of its target market—one or more specific groups of potential consumers toward which an organization directs its marketing program.

[ICA 1-2: What Makes a Better Mousetrap?]


	1.	The Four Ps: Controllable Marketing Mix Factors.  [LO 1-3]

After selecting its target market consumers, the firm must take steps to satisfy their needs.

	a.	A marketing department must develop a complete marketing program to reach its target market.

	b.	To do this, it uses “the four Ps”—a shorthand reference for:
	•	Product.  A good, service, or idea (offering) to satisfy consumers’ needs.
	•	Price.  What is exchanged for the product.
	•	Promotion.  A means of communication between the seller and the buyer.
	•	Place.  A means of getting the product to the consumer.

	c.	These are the elements of the marketing mix, which are:
	•	The marketing manager’s controllable factors—product, price, promotion, and place that…
	•	Can be used to solve a marketing problem.
	•	The marketing mix elements are called controllable factors because they are under the control of the marketing department in an organization.

c.	An effective marketing mix conveys to potential buyers a customer value proposition, which is the cluster of benefits that an organization promises customers to satisfy their needs.

SLIDE 19

	2.	The Uncontrollable, Environmental Forces.

	a.	Environmental forces are the uncontrollable forces that affect a marketing decision, which consist of:
	•	Social forces.  What consumers themselves want and need.
	•	Economic forces.  Whether the economy is expanding or contracting.
	•	Technological forces.  Changing technology.
	•	Competitive forces.  Actions competitors take.
	•	Regulatory forces.  Government restrictions.

	b.	These five forces may expand or restrict an organization’s marketing opportunities.

d.	Marketers can affect some of these forces, such as technology or competition, and achieve breakthroughs.

SLIDE 20

III.  THE MARKETING PROGRAM:
HOW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS ARE BUILT  [LO 1-4]

A marketing program connects the organization with its customers.

	A.	Relationship Marketing: Easy to Understand, Hard to Do

	•	Intense competition in global markets has caused many U.S. firms to focus on customer value.

	•	The essence of successful marketing is to provide unique value to gain loyal customers.

	a.	What is new is a more careful attempt at understanding how a firm’s customers perceive value.

	b.	The firm must then actually create and deliver that value to them.

	•	Customer value:

	a.	Is the unique combination of benefits received by targeted buyers.

	b.	Includes, at a specific price:
	•	Quality. 	•	On-time delivery.
	•	Convenience. 	•	Before-sale & after-sale service.

	•	Firms calculate the dollar value of a loyal, satisfied customer.  Example:
Kleenex = 6.7 boxes/year for 60 years = $994.

	•	Firms cannot succeed by being all things to all people.  Instead, they:

	a.	Must build long-term relationships with customers to…

	b.	Provide unique value to them.

	•	Three strategies used to deliver customer value include:

	a.	Best price: Target—its brand promise is to “Expect More.  Pay Less.”

	b.	Best product: Starbucks—stresses quality coffee that is ethically delivered.

d.	Best service: Nordstrom—works to “deliver the best possible shopping experience.”

WHEN THEY A BUY COFFEE, WHAT IS THE FIRST?

	•	Relationship marketing:

	a.	Links the organization to its individual customers, employees, suppliers, and other partners for their mutual long-term benefits.

	b.	Involves a personal, ongoing relationship between the organization and its individual customers that begins before and continues after the sale.

	•	Information technology, along with other cutting-edge processes, better enables companies to form relationships with customers. 

	a.	Done through:
	•	“Internet of everything” helps create detailed databases about product usage. 
	•	“Data analytics” offers insights into how products create value for customers.


	B.	The Marketing Program and Market Segments

	•	Product concepts are converted into a tangible marketing program—a plan that:

	a.	Integrates the marketing mix to…

	b.	Provide a good, service, or idea to prospective buyers.

	•	These products can then be targeted at market segments, which are the relatively homogeneous groups of prospective buyers that:

	a.	Have common needs and…

	b.	Will respond similarly to a marketing action.

	•	Figure 1-2 shows that organizations must continually and effectively develop new offerings that satisfy consumer needs, which can further stimulate this process.


LEARNING REVIEW

	1-4.	An organization can’t satisfy the needs of all consumers, so it must focus on one or more subgroups, which are its __________.

Answer: target market

	1-5.	What are the four marketing mix elements that make up the organization’s marketing program?

Answer: product, price, promotion, place

	1-6.	What are environmental forces?

Answer: Environmental forces are the uncontrollable forces that affect a marketing decision, which consist of social, economic, technological, competitive, and regulatory forces.

	C.	3M’s Strategy and Marketing Program to Help Students Study

	•	3M’s David Windorski:

	a.	Conducted research to understand  how college students really study.

	b.	Invented several 3M Post-it® brand products and wanted to add a new item.

	•	Windorski worked with a team of college students to:

	a.	Observe and question college students about their studying, such as how they:
	•	Used their textbooks. 	•	Wrote term papers.
	•	Took notes. 	•	Reviewed for exams.

	b.	They often observed students highlight a passage and mark a page in their textbooks with a Post-it® Note or Post-it® Flag.

	c.	Windorski realized he could help students study by:
	•	Marrying a Post-it® Note or Post-it® Flag with a colored highlighter to…
	•	Merging the functions of both into one product.

	1.	Moving from Ideas to a Marketable Highlighter Product.

	a.	After many models, Windorski concluded he had to:
	•	Build a highlighter that would dispense 3M Post-it® Flags because…
	•	The Post-it® Notes were too large to put inside the barrel of a highlighter.

	b.	The initial highlighter product with Post-it® Flags inside were produced and given to students—and also office workers—to get their reactions.

	c.	A suggestion from users quickly emerged:
	•	The product needed a convenient, reliable cover to protect the Post-it® Flags when it isn’t being used.
	•	Windorski added a rotating cover for the Post-it® Flags in the highlighter.
	•	The result: The Post-it® Flag Highlighter was born!

	2.	Adding the Post-it® Flag Pen.

	a.	Windorski considered other related products.

	b.	Windorski observed that many office workers need immediate access to
Post-it® Flags while writing longhand with pens.

	c.	Marketing research among office workers refined the design and showed the existence of a sizable market for a 3M Post-it® Flag Pen.

	d.	Marketing research also confirmed that college students would be a secondary market for a 3M Post-it® Flag Pen.

[Video 1-4: 3M Flag Highlighters Ad]

	3.	A Marketing Program for the Post-it® Flag Highlighter and Pen.

SLIDE 23

a.	[Figure 1-4] shows the strategies for each marketing mix element in 3M’s marketing program to college students and office workers for the Post-it®
Flag Highlighter and the Post-it® Flag Pen.
Appendix 3 FIGURE 1-3
The table lists marketing program action to reach strategies, listing four marketing mix elements and for each element the actions taken for the college student market segment, the actions taken for the the office worker market segment, and the rationale for the marketing program action.
1. Product strategy; offer Post-it Flag Highlighter to help collect students in their studying; offer Post-it Flag Pen to help office workers in their day-to-day work activities; listen carefully to the needs and wants of potential customer segments to use 3M technology to introduce a useful, innovative product.
2. Price strategy; seek retail price of about 3.99 dollars to 4.99 dollars for a single Post-it Flag Highlighter or 5.99 dollars to 7.99 dollars for a three-pack; seek retail price of about 3.99 dollars to 4.99 dollars for a single Post-it Flag Pen, wholesale prices are lower; set prices that provide genuine value to the customer segment being targeted.
3. Promotion strategy; run limited promotion with a TV ad and some ads in college newspapers and then rely on student word-of-mouth messages; run limited promotion among distributors to get them to stock the product; increase awareness among potential users who have never heard of this new innovative 3M product.
4. Place strategy; distribute Post-it Flag Highlighters through college bookstores, office supply stores, and mass merchandisers; distribute Post-it Flag Pens through office wholesalers and retailers as well as mass merchandisers; make it easy for prospective buyers to buy at convenient retail outlets (both products) or to get at work (Post-it Flag Pens only).


	b.	Comparing the marketing program for each product:
	•	Post-it® Flag Highlighter (shown in the orange column).
	–	The target market is mainly college students.
	–	To build student awareness, 3M:
	*	Used a mix of print ads in college newspapers and a TV ad.
	*	Relied on student word-of-mouth advertising.
	–	Gaining distribution in college bookstores was critical and would:
	*	Result in a reasonable retail price to students.
	*	Provide 3M and its distributors with an acceptable profit.
•	Post-it® Flag Pen 
–	The primary target market consists of office workers.
–	The secondary target market consists of students.
	–	Post-it® Flag Pens:
	*	Are mainly business products bought by an organization’s purchasing department.
	*	Are stocked as office supplies for employees to use.
•	The marketing program for Post-it® Flag Pens emphasize gaining distribution in outlets used by purchasing department managers.

	c.	The Post-it® Flag Highlighters and Post-it® Flag Pens were so successful that Windorski and his team received a prestigious award from 3M.

d.	In 2008, Windorski was invited to appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show:
	•	She personally thanked him for the Post-it® Flag Highlighter because…
	•	The product changed the way she read and evaluated books that she recommended for her book club.

4.	Extending the Product Line.

	a.	The success of the Post-it® Flag Highlighter and Post-it® Flag Pen:
	•	Led Windorski to create the second generation of the Post-it® Flag Highlighters and Pens…
	•	Without the rotating cover that makes it easier to insert replacement flags.

e.	The success of the second generation of products has led to a family of related products (i.e. product line extensions).

D.  How Marketing Became So Important

Marketing has become a driving force in the modern global economy.

		A.	Evolution of the Market Orientation


	1.	Marketing Concept 

	a.	The marketing concept is the idea that an organization should:
	•	Strive to satisfy the needs of consumers while also trying to achieve the organization’s goals.
	b.	General Electric:
	•	Probably launched the marketing concept in its 1952 annual report that …
	•	Advocated marketing “at the beginning rather than the end of the production cycle,” integrating marketing into each phase of business.

	c.	An organization that has a market orientation focuses its efforts on:
	•	Continuously collecting information about customers’ needs.
	•	Sharing this information across departments.
	•	Using it to create customer value.

B. Focusing on Customer Relationship Management

•	Social networking is a recent focus of the customer relationship era.
	•	Consists of using social media websites to develop relationships.
	•	Examples: Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.
	•	This relationship strategy is still evolving.

	a.	The focus on customers has led to customer relationship management (CRM), which is the process of:
	•	Identifying prospective buyers.
	•	Understanding them intimately.
	•	Developing favorable long-term perceptions of the organization and its offerings so that buyers will choose them in the marketplace.

	b.	This process requires:
	•	The commitment of managers and employees throughout the organization.
	•	A growing application of information, communication, and Internet technologies.

	c.	The foundation of CRM is customer experience, which is:
	•	The internal response that customers have to all aspects of an organization and its offering.
	•	This internal response includes:
–	Direct customer contacts (buying, obtaining, and using the offering).
–	Indirect contacts (word-of-mouth and news reports).

d.	Trader Joe’s customer experience:
•	Has unique customer experience and customer loyalty.
•	Offers its own brands at low prices.
•	Offers unusual, affordable products not available from other retailers.
•	Provides employee “engagement” customer service.

	e.	Sometimes there is a “disconnect” between what firms think they provide vs. what customers say they receive.  

	E.	Ethics and Social Responsibility in Marketing: Balancing the Interests of Different Groups

Today, the standards of marketing practice have shifted from an emphasis on producers’ interests to consumers’ interests.

	1.	Ethics.

	a.	Existing laws and regulations don’t address many marketing issues.

	b.	Organizations have developed codes of ethics to guide marketers.

	2.	Social Responsibility.

	a.	Is the idea that organizations are accountable to a larger society.

	b.	The societal marketing concept:
	•	Is the view that organizations should satisfy the needs of consumers in a way that provides for society’s well-being.

	F.	The Breadth and Depth of Marketing

Marketing affects every person and organization.

	1.	Who Markets?

	a.	Every organization markets: for profit business firms and nonprofits.

	b.	Places, special causes, and individuals also use marketing.

	2.	What is Marketed?

	a.	Goods.  Physical objects, such as toothpaste, cameras, or computers.

	b.	Services.  Intangible items, such as airline trips, financial advice, or art museums.

	c.	Ideas.  Thoughts about concepts, actions, or causes.

	d.	All three of the above are considered products, which:
	•	Consist of a bundle of tangible and intangible attributes that…
	•	Satisfy consumers’ needs and…
	•	Are received in exchange for money or something else of value.

[Video 1-5: Hermitage Tour Video]

	e.	Services like art museums rely more on effective marketing.

	f.	Ideas are often marketed by nonprofit organizations or government agencies.

	3.	Who Buys and Uses What Is Marketed?  Two groups do:

a.	Ultimate consumers are the people who use the products and services purchased for a household.

b.	Organizational buyers are those manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and government agencies that buy products and services for their own use or for resale.

c.	Both ultimate consumers and organizational buyers may also be called consumers, buyers, and customers.

	4.	Who Benefits?  Three specific groups benefit:

	a.	Consumers who buy.
	•	Competition ensures that consumers can find value from the best products, the lowest prices, or exceptional service in the marketplace.
	•	Provides jobs to raise the standard of living for a country’s citizens.

	b.	Organizations that sell.  Effective marketing actions reward organizations that serve consumers.

	c.	Society as a whole.  Marketing raises the standard of living for a country’s citizens by:
	•	Enhancing competition. 	•	Lowering prices.
	•	Improving product quality. 	•	Providing jobs.

	5.	How Do Consumers Benefit?  Marketing creates utility, the benefits or customer value received by users of the product.  Four different utilities are created:

	a.	Form utility.  Producing the product or service.

	b.	Place utility.  Having the offering available where needed.

	c.	Time utility.  Having the product or service available when needed.

	d.	Possession utility.  Making an item easy to purchase.

LEARNING REVIEW

	1-7.	What are the two key characteristics of the marketing concept?

Answer: An organization should (1) strive to satisfy the needs of consumers (2) while also trying to achieve the organization’s goals.

	1-8.	What is the difference between ultimate consumers and organizational buyers?

Answer: Ultimate consumers are the people who use the products and services purchased for a household.  Organizational buyers are those manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and government agencies that buy products and services for their own use or for resale.
